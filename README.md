**Welcome to Blog FrontEnd**

Just a quick explanation of what I used for this project:

- ReactJS
- ReactJS Router, to create the navigation of the site 
- I used the create-react-app to start the initial setup of the project.
- I designed a ``single page site`` as it was the quickest way to show the integration with the blog-api


To run this project you will need to do the following:

1.- Clone the repository:

```
    git clone https://github.com/mikewarrior/blog-frontend.git
```

2.- Go inside the repo once is downloaded and install the dependencies, running this command:

```
    npm install
```

3.- Run the blog-api ``FIRST``, see the README file to learn how to do it.

4.- Run the blog-frontend, with the following command:

```
    npm start
```

**Troubleshooting**

If for any reason, you app don't run, do the following:

1.- Delete your node_modules inside the blog-frontend repository:
```
    rm -rf your-path-to-blog-frontend/node-modules
```

2.- Install again the dependencies:
```
    npm install
```

3.- Run the app.

Have Fun :)!
